#PhantomJS

_**Note: This tutorial is still very much in progress.**_

It'll be aimed at beginners - both those who are new to [phatomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) and also people who are new to developing. I want to **encourage brand new developers to start testing from day 1** (if you're a dab hand at the dev stuff you can use the [contents guide](#contents) to skip to the interesting bits).

 I'll be publishing information here as I learn it myself and also questions I have as I go that I may want to answer.
